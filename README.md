# blockdj-react-web-app
web app for our project

You will need a directory in src called config with an index.js file

The config will look something like following...

export default {
    AUTH0:{
        ...Check in Slack for this...
    },
    SPOTIFY:{
        ...Check in Slack for this...
    }
};
